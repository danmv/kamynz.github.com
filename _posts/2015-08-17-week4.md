# Understanding Raw Data => To make a better analysis

After reading more the```GUide to STasitical Analysis in Microbial Ecology (GUSTA ME)``` [online guide](https://sites.google.com/site/mb3gustame/), I understood that it is important to asses multivariate normality on my data. Then, I read "MVN: An R Package for Assessing Multivariate Normality" [article](http://journal.r-project.org/archive/2014-2/korkmaz-goksuluk-zararsiz.pdf) by Selcuk Korkmaz, Dincer Goksuluk and Gokmen Zararsiz and used the MVN package to make the multivariate analysis of my raw data. 

# What did I use from the MVN package?

I used the following functions:

  * To test normality:

    1. **mardiTest()** <= "It is based on multivariate extensions of skewness and kurtosis" (cite article) 
    
    2. **hzTest()** <= "It is based on a non-negative functional distance that measures the distancebetween two distribution functions" (cite article)

  * To visualize and test univariate variables:

    1. **uniPlot()** <= It receives two arguments, which are data=numerical matriz and type = "qqplot" or "histogram"
    
    2. **uniNorm()** <= Function that executes a variety of  normality tests such as Shapiro-Wilk, Cramer-von Mises, etc. 

  * To detect multivariate outliers
 
    1. **mvOutlier** <= It receives three main arguments: A numerical matrix, a boolean to make or not a Q-Qplot and method to calculate a distance (e.g. Mahalanobis Distance and Adjusted Mahalanobis Distance)

# Before using MVN package, I decided to take a sample from each genome

### The columns taken for the anaylisis were values from: "AGTA" ; "ATCT"; "ACGC"; "TGAA"; "TTAG"

### The rows corresponded to the fragments of each genome => **_E. coli_ (2678 fragments) , _Shigella_ (2440 fragments) and _Rhizobium_ (3713 fragments)**
