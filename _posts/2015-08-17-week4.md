# Understanding Raw Data => To make a better analysis

After reading more the```GUide to STasitical Analysis in Microbial Ecology (GUSTA ME)``` [online guide](https://sites.google.com/site/mb3gustame/), I understood that it is important to asses multivariate normality on my data. Then, I read "MVN: An R Package for Assessing Multivariate Normality" [article](http://journal.r-project.org/archive/2014-2/korkmaz-goksuluk-zararsiz.pdf) by Selcuk Korkmaz, Dincer Goksuluk and Gokmen Zararsiz and used the MVN package to make the multivariate analysis of my raw data. 

# What did I use from the MVN package?

I used the following functions:

  * To test normality:

    1. mardiTest() <= "It is based on multivariate extensions of skewness and kurtosis" (cite article) 
    2. hzTest() <= "It is based on a non-negative functional distance that measures the distancebetween two distribution functions" (cite article)

  * Graphical visualization:

    1. uniPlot() => It receives two arguments, which are data=numerical matriz and type = "qqplot" or "histogram"

  * To visualize and test univariate variables:

    1.
