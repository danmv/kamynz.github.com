# New Advances

I have been working in the pre-processing of the raw data and looking for the parameters that are giving the best results, so I
want to specify some key points about the methodology of my thesis:

1. Downloading genomes from each domain (e.g. Archaea, Bacteria and Eukaryota)

    * I have 62 genomes so far
    * I am going to select the biggest chromosomes for each Eukaryota

2. Fragmenting genomes with Pyfasta package in order to get 2025 fragments for each genome

    * I am doing images from overlapping fragments (50% of overlapping) and non-overlapping fragments

3. Calcuting tetranucleotide frequencies and biases for each genome in order to make a matrix like the following:

    * Frequency matrix (Image)

4. Using PCA, PCoA and NMDS in order to get the first 3 components

5. Generating squared image in which nrows=45 and ncols=45

## Last Images from 7 Genomes non-overlapping fragments after Z_score transformation

*(E. coli, Shigella, Rhizobium, Saccharomyces (Chromoses 15 and 7), Drosophila (Chromoses Sexual and id:3777)

* The R code for the functions is in https://github.com/KamyNz/kamynz.github.com/blob/master/Scripts/Thesis_R_Functions_Last_Modified.R

``Note: I am opened to any suggestion about my R code in order to make it more efficient.``
