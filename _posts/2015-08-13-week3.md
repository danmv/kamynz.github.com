### Third Results

During this week, I have discussed my results with members of the BCEM [web page](http://bcem.uniandes.edu.co/wordpress/). Then, I decided to use three genomes (E. coli, Shigella and Rhizobium) for all my tests during the development of my thesis. 

### WHAT I HAVE DONE:

1. I have created three images of each genome when I combined them in the same PCA (This data is not normalized)

2. I have sent to the cluster a file that runs `metaMDS` from the vegan library [Scripts to sent this job](kamynz.github.com/Scripts/)

3. I know that I should not use Colsums as a normalized method

### WHAT I HAVE TO DO:

1. I have to create the new three images with normalized data (Z score, sqrt)

2. I have to review the literature about k-mers frequency in Prokaryota and the OligonucleotideFrequency function of BioStrings,which will allow to get better counts

3. I have to test the NMS and metric scaling methods

4. I have to search what statistical methods will allow to know which variables affect more my 3 principal components for
the color vector
