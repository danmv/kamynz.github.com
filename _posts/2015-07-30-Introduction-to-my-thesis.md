### Introduction

The objective of my thesis is to create an image from a genome but this image should have a biological insight. Because humans are more capable of finding patterns visually than by reading a plain text, creating an image from a genome is a great way of understanding the data. Also, there is not a standardized methodology on the literature related with my project, so my thesis director and I made a draft of a methodology that we want to try as specified in this file [preliminary project in Spanish](/Additional_material/Preliminary_project_Spanish.docx)
